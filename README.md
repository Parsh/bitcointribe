## Building HEXA

### Prerequisites:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Make sure you have `rn-nodeify` as a global dependency. If you don't, run `npm install -g rn-nodeify`.

```
git clone https://github.com/bithyve/hexa.git
cd hexa
yarn install
```

If you're on windows, open setup.bat in a text editor and enter your user account name where prompted. If you changed the location of the android sdk during installation, enter the path to the sdk instead of the one already present.
Then, from the command prompt, run:

```
setup.bat
```

Make sure you have `.env` similar to `.env.example` in your project's root directory before running hexa. If this file is not present with the required values then the app will crash.

### Run on iOS

```
yarn ios
```

### Run on Android

```
yarn android
```

## Verify Authenticity of Android APK

Please download and keep all these files in the same location: `Android APK file, SHA256SUM.asc, HEXA_DETACHED_SIGN.sign`. Make a copy of `Android APK file` and rename it as `Android APK clone`.

Get the public PGP key for `hexa@bithyve.com` (Hexa Team's PGP key) using

```
gpg --recv-key "389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62"
```

or

```
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key "389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62"
```

**Verify APK certificate**

Rename `Android APK clone.apk` to `Android APK clone.zip` and extract the following file: `/META-INF/HEXAWALL.RSA`. Verify the certificate using `keytool`:

```
keytool -printcert -file HEXAWALLET.RSA
Certificate fingerprints:
	 ...
	 MD5:  5E:92:30:9B:88:F4:A1:17:08:D1:DB:C3:2A:BF:4D:5A
	 SHA1: 38:55:07:26:F4:C6:C4:3E:A2:87:CF:16:11:7C:E6:A5:66:E1:CB:C1
	 SHA256: 77:82:54:70:5D:C4:DA:83:2C:F8:39:96:49:69:FE:AF:63:BD:79:EF:00:0A:34:43:86:0C:7C:AD:A2:55:1C:95
	 Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA
	 Version: 3
```

**Verify APK checksum**

Verify the checksum against the APK using:

```
shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUM.asc
```

Output should contain the name of the APK file followed by **OK** as shown below:

```
Hexa_Wallet_Android_v1.1.1.apk: OK
```

**Verify that the signed checksum is from hexa@bithyve.com**

```
gpg --verify SHA256SUM.asc
```

Output should show Hexa's PGP key **389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62**:

```
using RSA key 389F4CADA0785AC0E28A0C181BEBDE261DC3CF62
issuer "hexa@bithyve.com"
Good signature from "Hexa Team (Hexa Bitcoin Wallet) <hexa@bithyve.com>"
```

**Alternate method for verifying PGP signature**

Verify the detached signature against the APK file:

```
gpg --verify HEXA_DETACHED_SIGN.sign Hexa_Wallet_Android_v1.1.1.apk
```

Output should show Hexa's PGP key **389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62**:

```
using RSA key 389F4CADA0785AC0E28A0C181BEBDE261DC3CF62
issuer "hexa@bithyve.com"
Good signature from "Hexa Team (Hexa Bitcoin Wallet) <hexa@bithyve.com>"
```
